        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the "Balloon Popper AR" app (the "Service") created by Raj Koppola. This
            service is intended for use by children and families.</p>

        <h2>Commitment to Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our app. This policy explains our information
            practices in accordance with the <strong>U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>

        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not knowingly collect, store, or share any personal information from children.</strong> We do
            not require users to sign in, create an account, or provide names, addresses, emails, or phone numbers.</p>

        <h3>Camera Usage (Augmented Reality)</h3>
        <p>The app requires access to your device's camera to enable Augmented Reality (AR) features. This data is
            processed locally on your device by Apple's ARKit. <strong>We do not record, save, or transmit any video or
                images from your camera.</strong> The camera feed is used solely to display virtual balloons in your
            real-world environment.</p>

        <h3>AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
        <p>We use Google AdMob to display age-appropriate advertisements to support the free version of the app. We have
            configured AdMob to comply with COPPA regulations by enabling the <strong>"Tag for Child Directed
                Treatment"</strong> setting.</p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google will not serve personalized ads (behavioral advertising) to users of this app.</li>
            <li>Ads shown will be based on context (the app content) rather than user data.</li>
            <li>No user identifiers (like IDFA) are used to track users across other apps or websites.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect personal information, we do not share any personal information with third parties.
        </p>

        <h2>Parental Control</h2>
        <p>If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under 13, please contact us
            immediately so we can remove strict measures to delete it.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:</p>
